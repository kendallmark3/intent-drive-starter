Run `hooks/pre-implement.sh` before coding.

It passes when the intent states an Outcome and a Success / Evidence. It does not require requirements, architecture, implementation steps, or exhaustive acceptance criteria.

When this repo is installed as a plugin, `hooks.json` runs `pre-implement-hook.sh` before every Edit and Write. In a project that has `intent/current-feature.md`, code edits are blocked until the check passes. Markdown files are never blocked, and projects without that file are left alone.
